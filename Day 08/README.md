# MATLAB Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains two MATLAB scripts demonstrating sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort** and **Insertion Sort**.

## Contents

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Insertion Sort**

---

## 1. Bubble Sort

**File contains:**
- Initialization of an unsorted array
- Display of the original array
- Bubble sort implementation as a function
- Timing the sorting operation using `tic` and `toc`
- Display of the sorted array and execution time

### Sample Input
```matlab
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 1, 90];
```

### Output
Displays the original array, the sorted array, and the time taken to sort.

---

## 2. Insertion Sort

**File contains:**
- Initialization of an unsorted array
- Display of the original array
- Insertion sort implementation as a function
- Display of the sorted array

### Sample Input
```matlab
arr = [74, 2, 36, 89, 5, 12];
```

### Output
Displays the original and sorted array.

## Notes
- `clc` and `clearvars` are used to clear the console and variables before running each sort.
- Ensure the function definitions are in separate files or placed after the main script section to avoid scope issues in MATLAB.
- Time measurement is only implemented in the Bubble Sort script.

## How to Run
Copy and paste each block into separate MATLAB script files or run in sections within the MATLAB environment.
